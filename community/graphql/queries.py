"""Community GraphQL Queries Module

This module provides comprehensive GraphQL query resolvers for the community management system.
It handles all community-related data retrieval operations including:

- Community and subcommunity information
- Membership management and user roles
- Community goals, activities, affiliations, and achievements
- Community recommendations and feeds
- Role-based access control and permissions

The module supports both regular communities and subcommunities with proper authorization
and error handling through decorators.

Key Features:
- JWT-based authentication for all queries
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Support for filtering by community type, circle, and category
- Comprehensive error handling with custom decorators
- Neo4j database integration for graph-based relationships
- Optimized queries for performance
