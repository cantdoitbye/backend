# Community Module

## Overview

The **Community** module is a comprehensive system for managing communities, subcommunities, and associated features within the Ooumph backend. It provides a complete social platform infrastructure with support for messaging, elections, roles, memberships, and Matrix chat integration.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Models**: 25+ Neo4j-based models for data persistence  
- **GraphQL API**: Complete CRUD operations via GraphQL schema  
- **Services**: Notification and business logic services  
- **Utils**: Helper functions for Matrix integration, community generation, and data processing  
- **Admin Interface**: Django admin configuration (currently commented out)
